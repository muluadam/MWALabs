1- Make sure you have mongoDB installed and running on your system. Create a SchoolDB with a Students collection. Then add the following documents:

John, 3.3
James, 2.5
Jasmin, 3.8

2- Export the SchoolDB to a json file as a pretty array and upload that.

3- Import the games DB found in the resources folder. Then write a NodeJS program to display 5 games from database or as many as the user specifies but not exceeding 7. (this is your mean games project).
